Danielle: I'm telling you dad didn't come home last night. They had a fight, a bad one.

Andrew: How bad?

Danielle: Like divorce court bad. Listen to her, she always overcompensates when she's worried.

Andrew: If dad moves out and leaves us with her, I'll lose my mind.

Bree: Dinner is on the table.

Andrew: Mom, where did dad go last night?

Bree: He got a last minute call to speak at a medical conference in Philadelphia. Take your seats.

Danielle: This marriage is so over.
