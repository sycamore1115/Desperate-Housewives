Gabrielle: I love taking baths, especially with you, it's like taking a vocation from the world.

John: I hated taking baths when I was a kid. Of course, back then, the only thing I had to play with was my rubber ducky.
      Who's that? It's Mr. Solis.

Gabrielle: Relax, Calors is at work and he doesn't ring the doorbell. It's the cable guy, he's three hours late, use the side entrance.

Gabrielle knew her vacation from the world had ended. What she didn't know was John had left behind a souvenir.
