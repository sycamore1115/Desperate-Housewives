Previously on Desperate Housewives:
Susan played with fire and could get burned, 
Gabrielle found herself a playmate, 
Whilst Lynette couldn't get her kids to stop palying,
and Bree played hardball, 
everyone has a little dirty laundry.

When I was alive I maintained many diffrent identities, lover, wife and ultimately victim. 
Yes, labels are important to the living, they dictate how people see themselves.
Like my friend Lynette, she used to see herself as a career woman, and a hugely successful one at that.
She was known for her power lunches, her eye-catching presentations, and her ruthlessness in wiping out the competition.
But Lynette gave up her career to assume a new label, the incredibly satisfying role of full time mother.

Lynette: Scavo residence, yes, this is me.
