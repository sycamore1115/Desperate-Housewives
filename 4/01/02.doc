But unfortunately for Lynette, this new label frequently fell short of what was advertised.

Lynette: How in the world did they ...?

Teacher: I left the door to the art supply cupboard open for five minutes, that's all, five minutes.

Lynette: The little girl, why didn't she say anything?

Teacher: Your boys work quickly.

Lynette: Well, obviously, they will be punished for this, severely

Teacher: I hesitate in bringing this up, since you got so ugly about it last time.

Lynette: They don't have attention deficit disorder, and I'm not gonna drug my boys just to make your job easier, I'd rather change teachers.

Teacher: The boys are in my class, because I'm the only teacher who can handle them.

Lynette: What if we separate the twins, put them in different classes? They're much calmer when they're not bouncing off one another.

Teacher: We can try that, but if it doesn't work, we may no longer be able to accommodate them.

It suddenly occurred to Lynette, her lable was about to change yet again. 
And for the next few years, she would be know as the mother of the boys who painted Tiffany Axelrod blue.
