Cable guy: Again sorry I was late, the scheduler overbooked me.

Gabrielle: How long are you going to be?

Cable guy: Almost done, what is that scent? Is that sage and citrus? That's amazing.

Gabrielle: Try to hurry, I have stuff to do.

Carlos: What's happening?

Gabrielle: The cable guy fell, he hit his head on the tub, he may have a concussiono.

Carlos: It's almost eight.

Gabrielle: He was late.
