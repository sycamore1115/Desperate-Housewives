Julie: Mom, the dish is clean. I still don't understand why you don't just ask him out on an official date date.

Susan: I'm trying a new stratege, I'm playing hard to get.

Julie: How long do you think you can keep that up?

Susan: Maybe until noon. Then I'm going to have to run over there and beg him to love me.

Julie: Mom, I don't think you're gonna be able to wait that long.

Susan: You got to be kidding, she washed her car yesterday. Oh no, she's not. Yep, she's bringing out the big guns.

Julie: You better get over there, she's wearing cotton.

Susan: What am I supposes to say? "I saw you half-naked and I thought I'd drop by"? What's that?

Julie: A piece of Mike's junk mail we got by mistake, I held onto it in case of an emergency.

Susan: God bless you.
