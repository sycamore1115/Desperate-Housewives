It looked to be an interesting afternoon on Wisteria Lane, a mysterious cassette tape had been discovered by my friend Bree, 
she has stolen it from her marriage counselor, a counselor I'd once spoken to in strictest confidence. 

Dr. Goldfine: So how have you been?

Alice: I had the nightmare again.

Gabrielle: It's weird to hear Mary Alice.

Dr. Goldfine: Still the same one?

Alice: Yes, but this time I was standing in a river, and I saw the girl under the water, and she kept screaming 'Angela' over and over again.

Dr. Goldfine: So what do you think the significance of the name 'Angela' is?

Alice: Actually, that's my real name.

Gabrielle: Her real name? That doesn't make any sense, I've seen her driver's license, I did not say 'Angela'.

Susan: Bree, what does it say in the rest of the tape?

Bree: Just more about her nightmares, and this girl she was afraid of.

Gabrielle: So what the hell do we do now?

Susan: I think we should show Paul the note.

Lynette: Are you sure? He's gonna freak.

Bree: Well, it's now or never, I mean I saw he's asking for the place, It's gonna sell quickly.

Gabrielle: Can I say something? I'm glad Paul is moving. I'm sorry, he's just always given me the creeps.
           Haven't you guys noticed, he has this dark thing going on? Somehing about him just feels... 

Lynette: Malignant?

Susan: We've all sort of felt it.

Bree: That being said, I do love what he's down with that lawn.
