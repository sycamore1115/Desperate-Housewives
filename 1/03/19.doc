Rex: I can't believe you tried to kill me.

Bree: Yes, well, I feel badly about that. I told you, Mrs. Huber came over and I got distracted. It was a mistake.

Rex: Since when do you make mistakes?

Bree: Whatâ€™s that supposed to mean? 

Rex: It means I'm sick of you being so damn perfect all the time.
     I'm sick of the bizarre way you hair doesn't move.
     I'm sick of you making our bed in the morning before I've even used the bathroom.
     You're the plastic suburban housewife with her pearls and spatula, who says things like "we owe the Hendersons a dinner."
     Where's the woman I fell in love with. Who used to burn the toast and drink milk out of the carton? and laugh? I need her.
     Not this cold, perfect thing you've become.

Bree: These need water.     

Bree sobbed quietly in the restroom for five minutes, but her busband never knew. Because when Bree finally emerged, she was perfect.
