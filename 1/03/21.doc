Susan: Mrs. Huber, how are you doing?

Huber: Not too well, I'm afraid. I'm trying to find something to soothe my stomach.

Susan: It's upset?

Huber: Yeah. I had the worst macaroni and cheese at the wake. It's been running through me ever since. 
       And I need to be at my best. Edie Britt's son is spending the night tonight.

Susan: He's spending the night?

Huber: Apparently Edie is having a gentleman friend over for dinner. and I think she plans on entertaining into the wee hours.
       if you know what I mean. ... Oh, here's some antacid, have you ever tried this?
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Susan: I can't believe it. This can't be happening. Mike can't like Edie better than me. He just can't.       

Julie: You don't know what's going on. Maybe they're just having dinner. You're right, they're doing it.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Susan: Edie? Hello? Anybody home? I need to borrow sugar.

And just like that, the possibility Susan had clung to, the maybe of Mike Delfino, was gone forever.
And despite the precariousness of her situation. Susan took a moment to mourn her loss.
It didn't take Susan long to realize, this was just not her night.

Edie: Is somebody out there? Oh my god! That's smoke.
