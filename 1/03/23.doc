Mike: Wow! What happened?

And suddenly there he was. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes.

Susan: Mike! I thought you were... Where were you?

Mike: I just got back from the movies. Edie had a fire, huh?

Susan: Yeah, but she's fine now. Everything's fine now.

And just like that, Susan was happy. Life was suddenly full of possibilities.
