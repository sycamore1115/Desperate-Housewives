Lynette: I wasn't expecting you for a week.

Lynette: It's been a little rough.

Tom: Hi, Yean, Peaches.

son: daddy, Did you buy us any presents?

     But I'm not giving it to you unless you promise to go outside right now  and practise throwing for 20 minutes. You promise?

Lynette: Let's risk it?
