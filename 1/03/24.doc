Susan: I brought some champagne. I thought we should have a toast.

The next day my friends came together to pack away my clothes, my personal belongings and what was left of my life.

Susan: All right, ladies, lift'em up. To Mary Alice, a good friend and neighbor. wherever you are, we hope you've found peace.

Lynette/Gabrielle/Bree: To Mary Alice.

Lynette: Let's get this show on the road.

Gabrielle: You guys, check out Mary Alice's clothes. Size eight? Ha! She always told me she was a size six. 
           Guess we found the skeleton in her closet.

Not quite, Gabrielle, not quite.

Gabrielle: What's that.

Bree: It's a letter addressed to Mary Alice.

How ironic. To have something I tried so desperately to keep secret, treated so casually.

Lynette: What are you doing? That's private.

Gabrielle: It's open. What's the big deal?

letter ---- I know what you did. It make me sick. I'm going to tell.

Susan: What does this mean?

Lynette: I don't know. But check out the postmark.

Bree: Oh, my god. She got it the day she died.

Gabrielle: Do you think this is why she ... ?

I'm so sorry, girls. I never wanted you to be burdened with this.

Susan: Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?
