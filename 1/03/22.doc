Bree: She ran out with nothing on. 

Lynette: She was having sex with some guy when the fire started.

Gabrielle: What happened to him?

Lynette: He got smoke inhalation. He's at the hospital.

Gabrielle: Oh, honey, don't worry about Edie. She's a strong lady.

Lynette: Absolutely. She'll get through this. She'll find a way to survive.

Bree: We all do.
