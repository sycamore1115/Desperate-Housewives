Bree Van De Kamp, who lives next door, 
brought baskets of muffins she baked from scratch.

Bree was known for her cooking,
and for making her own clothes,
and for doing her own gardening,
and for reupholstering her own furniture.

Yes, Bree's many talents were know throughout the neighborhood.
And everyone on Wisteria Lane thought of Bree as the perfect wife and mother.
Everyone, that is, except her own family.

Bree: Paul, Zachary.

Zachary: Helllo, Mrs. Van De Kamp.

Paul: Bree, you shouldn't have gone to all this trouble.

Bree: It was no trouble at all.
      Now, the basket with the red ribbon is filled with desserts for your guests,
      but the one with the blue ribbon is just for you and Zachary.
      It's got rolls, muffins, breakfast type things.

Paul: Thank you.

Bree: Well, the least I could do is make sure you boys had a decent meal 
      to look forward to in the morning.
      I know you're out of your minds with grief.
    
Paul: Yes, we are.    

Bree: Of course, I will need the baskets back once you're done.

Paul: Of course.
