Mary Alice: Soï¼Œwhat did Carl say when you confronted him?

Susan: You'll love this. He said "It doesn't mean anything, It was just sex."

Bree: Ah, yes, page one of the philanderer's handbook.

Susan: Yeah, and then he got this Zen look on his face, and he said, 
       "you know, Susan, most men live lives of quiet desperation."

Lynette: Please tell me you punched him.

Susan: No, I said, "Really? And what do most women lead, lives of noisy fulfillment?"

Mary Alice: Hmm, good for you.

Susan: I mean, of all people, did he have to bang his secretary?
       I had that woman over for brunch.

Gabrielle: It's like my grandmother always said
           an erect penis doesn't have a conscience.

Lynette: Even the limp ones aren't that ethical.

Bree: This is half the reason I joined the NRA.
      Well, when Rex started going to those medical conferences,
      I want it in the back of his mind that he had a loving wife at home 
      with a loaded Simth & Wesson.

Mary Alice: Lynnie, Tom's always away on business. Do you ever worry he might?

Lynette: Oh, please, the man's got me pregnant three times in four years.
         I wish he was having sex with someone else.

Bree: So, Susan, is he gonna stop seeing that woman?

Susan: I don't know. I'm sorry, you guys, I just don't know how I'm gonna survive this.

Mary Alice: Listen to me, We all have moments of desperation.
            But if we can face them head on, 
            that's how we find out just how strong we really are.
