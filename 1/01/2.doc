I was laid to rest on a Monday.
After the funeral, all the residents of Wisteria Lane came to pay their respects.
And, as people do in these situations, they brought food.


Lynette Scavo brought fried chicken.
Lynette had a great family recipe for fried chicken.
Of course, she didn't cook much while she was moving up the corporate ladders.
She didn't have the time.

But when her doctor announced Lynette was pregnant,
her husband Tom had an idea.

"Why not quit your job?"
"Kids do better with stay-at-home moms."
"So it would be so much less stressful"

But this was not the case.

In fact, Lynette's life had become so hectic,
she was now forced to get her fried chicken from the fast-food restaurant.

Lynette would've appreciated the irony if she'd thought about it.
But she couldn't. she didn't have the time.

Lynette: Stop it, stop it, stop it
Lynette's son: But, mom
Lynette: No, You are going to behave today.
         I am not going to be humiliated in front of the entire neighborhood.
         And, just so you know how serious I am ...
Lynette's son: What's that?
Lynette: Santa's cell-phone number.
Lynette's son: How did you get that?
Lynette: I know someone who knows someone who knows an elf.
         And if any of you acts up,
         so help me, I will call Santa and I will tell him you want socks for Christmas.
         Are you willing to risk that?
Lynette: Ok, Let's get this over with.
