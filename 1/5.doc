Susan Mayer, who lives across the street, brought macaroni and cheese.
Her husband, Carl, always teased her about her macaroni,
saying it was the only thing she knew how to cook and she rarely made it well.

It was too salty the night she and Carl moved into their house.
It was too watery the night she found lipstick on Carl's shirt.
She burned it the night Carl told her he was leaving her for his secretary.

A year had passed since the divorce.
Susan has started to think how nice it would be to have a man in her life.
Even one who would make fun of her cooking.

Julie(Susan's daughter): Mom, why would someone kill themselves?

Susan: Well, sometimes people are so unhappy, 
       they think that's the only way they can solve their problems.

Julie: But Mrs. Young always seemed happy.

Susan: Yeah, sometimes people pretend to be one way on the outside
       when they're totally different on the inside.

Julie: Ohï¼Œyou mean like how dad's girlfriend is always smiling and says nice things,
       but deep down, you just know she's a bitch.

Susan: I don't like that word, Julie. But, yeah, that's a great example.
