Lynette: Ease up, you little vampire.

Mrs. Huber: Lynette, I've been looking all over for you.
            Are you aware of what your sons are doing?

son: Cannonball!            

Lynette: Stop! What are you doing? We are at a wake.

son: When we got here, You said we could go in the pool.

Lynette: I said you could go by the pool. Do you have your swimsuits on?

son: Yeah, we put them on under our clothes just before we left. 

Lynette: You three planned this? All right. That's it. Get out.
         I am your mother. You have to do what I say. Come on.

son: We wanna swim and you can't stop us!

Lynette: Think I won't get in this pool and just grab you? Get out! Get over here.       

Lynette: Paul, we have to leave now. Once again, I am so sorry for your loss.

Lynette shouldn't have been so concerned about my husband. 
He had other things on his mind. Things below the surface.
