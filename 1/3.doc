Gabrielle Solis who lives down the block brought a spicy paella.
Since her modeling days in New York,
Gabrielle had developed a taste for rich food and rich men.

Carlos, who worked in mergers and acquisitions, proposed on their third date.
Gabrielle was touched when tears welled up in his eyes.
But she soon discovered this happened every time Carlos closed a big deal.

Gabrielle liked her paella piping hot.
However, her relationship with her husband was considerably cooler.

Carlos:     If you talk to Al Mason at this thing,
            I want you to casually mention how much I paid for your necklace.

Gabrielle:  Why don't I just pin the receipt to my chest?

Carlos:     He let me know how much he paid for his wife's convertible.
            Look, just work it into the conversation.

Gabrielle:  There's no way I can just work that in, Carlos.        

Carlos:     Why not? At the Donahue party, everyone was talking mutual funds,
            And you found a way to mentioned you slept with half the Yankee outfield.

Gabrielle:  I'm telling you, it came up in the context of the conversation.        

Carlos:     Hey, people are starting to stare. Can you keep you voice down, please?

Gabrielle:  Absolutely, We wouldn't want them to think we're not happy.
