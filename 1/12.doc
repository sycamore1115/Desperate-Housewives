Gabrielle: You can't order me around like I am a child. No,no. I'm not going.

Carlos: It's business. Tanaka expects everyone to bring their wives.

Gabrielle: Every time I'm around that man, he tries to grab my ass.

Carlos: I made over 200,000 doing business with him last year. If he wants to grab your ass, you let him.

Carlos: John!

John: Mr. Solis, you scared me.

Carlos: Why is that bush still there? You were supposed to dig it up last week.

John: I didn't have time last week.

Carlos: I don't want to hear your excuses. Just take care of it.

Gabrielle: I really hate the way you talk to me.

Carlos: And I really hate that I spent $15,000 on your diamond necklace that you couldnâ€™t live without.
        But I'm learning to deal with it. So, can I tell Tanaka we'll be there tomorrow night?

Gabrielle: John, we have bandages top shelf in the kitchen.         

John: Thanks, Mrs. Solis.

Gabrielle: Fine, I'll go. But I'm keeping my back pressed against the wall the entire time.

Carlos: See, now this is what a marriage is all about. Compromise.

Gabrielle: Is your finger ok?

John: Yeah, it's just a small cut.

Gabrielle: Let me see. Mmm.

John: You know, Mrs. Solis, I really like it when we hook up, 
      but you know, I gotta get my work done and I can't afford to lose this job.

Gabrielle: This table was hand-carved. Carlos had it imported from Italy. It cost him $23,000.

John: You want to do it on the table this time?

Gabrielle: Absolutely.
