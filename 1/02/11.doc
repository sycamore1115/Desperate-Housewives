Susan: Hi, Mike. I brought you a litter house-warming gift.
       I probably should've borught something by earlier, but...

Mike: Actually, you're the first neighborhood to stop by.

Susan: Really?

Susan knew she was lucky. An eligible bachelor had moved onto Wisteria Lane.
and she was the first to find out. 
But she also knew that good news travels quickly.

Edie: Hello there.

Edie Britt was the most predatory divorcee in a five-block radius.
Her conquests were numerous. varied. and legendary.

Edie: Hi, Susan. I hope I'm not interrupting. You must be Mike Delfino.
      Hi，I'm Edie Britt. I live over there. Welcome to Wisteria Lane.

Susan had met the enemy. And she was a slut.     

Mike: Thank you. What's this?

Edie: Sausage puttanesca. It's just something I threw together.

Mike: Thanks, Edie. That's great. I'd invite you both in,
      but I was sort of in the middle of something.

Susan: I'm late for an appointment anyway.    
Edie: No problem, I just wanted to say hi.

And just like that, the race for Mike Delfino had begun.
For a moment, Susan wondered if her rivalry with Edie would remain friendly.
But she was reminded that when it came to men —— Women don't fight fair.

Edie: Oh, Mike. I heard you're a plumber.
      Do you think you could stop by later tonight and take a look at my pipes?

Mike: Sure.
