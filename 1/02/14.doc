Three days after my funeral, Lenette replaced her grief with a much more useful emotion - Indignation.

Lenette: Tom, this is my fifth message, and you still haven't called me back. 
         Well, you must be having a lot of fun on your business trip. I can only imagine.
         Well, guess what? The kids and I want to have some fun, too. 
         So unless you call me back by noon, We are getting on a plane and joining you.
         Not now, honey. Mommy's threatening Daddy. Where are your brothers?

Klein: Lenette Scavo?

Lenette: Crap. Natalie Klein. I don't believe it.

Klein: Lenette. How long has it been?

Lenette: Years. Uh, how are you? How's the firm?

Klein: Good. Everyone misses you. We all say if you hadn't quit, you'd be running the place by now.

Lenette: Yeah, well.

Klein: So, how's domestic life? Don't you just love being a mom? 

And there it was. The question that Lynette always dreaded. 
For those who asked it, only one answer was acceptable. So Lynette responded as she always did. She lied.

Lenette: Well, to be honest, It's the best job  I've ever had.
