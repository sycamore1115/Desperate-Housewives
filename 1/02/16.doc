Susan: How would you feel about me using your child support payments for plastic surgery?

Julie: Stop being so nervous. You're just asking him out to dinner. It's no big deal.

Susan: You're right. So is that your project for school? You know, when I was in fifth grade, I made the White House out of sugar cubes.

Julie: Stop stalling and go. Before Mike figures out he can do detter.

Susan: Tell me again why I fought for custody of you.

Julie: You were using me to hurt Dad.

Susan: Oh, that's right.

Mike: Noï¼Œnot at all. What's up?

Susan: Well, I just was wondering if there was any chance that you... I just wanted to ask if... Edie. What are you...?

Edie: I was making ambrosia, And I made too much so I thought I'd bring some over to Mike. What's going on?

Mike: Susan was just going to ask me something.

Susan: I have a clog. And you're a plumber, right? The clog's in the pipe.

Mike: Yeah. That's usually where they are.

Susan: Well, I've got one.

Mike: Ok, let me get my tools.

Susan: Now? You want to come over now? You have company.

Edie: I don't mind.

Mike: Just give me two minutes. I'll be right over.

Susan: That's it. Just stuff the hair down there.

Julie: I stuffed it. It's not enough to clog it.

Susan: Here, look, Put in this peanut butter and this cooking oil. And these olives.

Julie: Mom, I'm telling you, it's not working.

Susan: Oh, god. That's him. How am I going to stop up the sink?

Mike: Well, here's your problem. Looks like somebody stuffed a bunch of popsicle sticks down here.

Susan: I've told Julie a million times not to play in the kitchen. Kids, you know.
