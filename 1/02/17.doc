waiter: All right, I'll go put in your orders, And I'll be right back with your drinks and your plates for the salad bar.

Rex: Thank you.

Bree: Andrew, Danielle, napkins?

Andrew: They have video games. Could we go play until our food gets here?

Bree: Andrew, this is family time. I think that we should all...

Rex: Go ahead and play.

Bree: I know that you think I'm angry about coming here, but I'm not. You and the kids wanted a change of pace, something fun, I get it.
      Probably we'll want something healthier tomorrow night, though. I'm thinking about chicken, Saltimbocca.

Rex: I want a divorce. I just can't live in this detergent commercial anymore.

waiter: The salad bar's right over there. Help yourself.

Rex: Thank you.

Bree: Um, I think I'll go get your salad for you.

Huber: Bree Van De Kamp.

Bree: Oh. Hello, Mrs. Huber.

Huber: We didn't get a chance to talk at Mary Alice's wake. How are you doing?

Bree longed to share the truth about her husband's painful betrayal, but sadly for Bree, admitting defeat was not an option.

Bree: Great. Everything is just great. 

Bree: Ok, well, I got you the honey mustard dressing. The ranch looked just a little bit suspect.

Rex: Are we going to talk about what I said?

Bree: If you think I'm going to discuss the dissolution of my marriage in a place 
      where the restrooms are labeled "chicks" and "dudes", you're out of your mind.

Rex: What's in this?

Bree: What do you mean, What's in this? It's salad.

Rex: With onion.

Bree: What?

Rex: You put onion in my salad.

Bree: No, I didn't. Oh waitâ€¦
