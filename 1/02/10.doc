The morning after my funeral, 
my friends and neighbors quitely went back to their busy, busy lives.
While some did their cooking.
And some did their cleaning.
And some did their yoga.
Others did their "homework"

Julie: Hi, I'm Julie. I kicked my soccer ball into your backyard
Mike: Oh, ok. Well, let's go round and get it.

Julie: His wife died a year ago. 
       He wanted to stay in LA, but there were too many memories.
       He is renting for tax purposes, but He hopes to buy a place real soon.

Susan: I can't believe you went over there.

Julie: Hey, I saw you both flirting at the wake. You are obviously into each other.
       Now that you know he is single, you can ask him out.

Susan: Julie, I like Mr. Delfino, I do.
       I just... I don't know if I'm ready to start dating yet.

Julie: You need to get back out there.
       Come on. How long has it been since you've had sex?
       Are you mad that I asked you that?

Susan: No, I'm just trying to remember.       
       I don't wanna talk to you about my love life anymore. It weirds me out.

Julie: I wouldn't have said anything. It's just...       

Susan: What?

Julie: I heard Dad's girlfriend ask if you'd dated anyone since the divorce.
       And Dad said he doubted it. And then they both laughed.
