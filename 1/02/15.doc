John: You know what I don't get? 

Gabrielle: What? 

John: Why you married Mr. Solis.

Gabrielle: Well, he promised to give me everything I've ever wanted.

John: And did he?

Gabrielle: Yse.

John: Then why aren't you happy?

Gabrielle: Turns out I wanted all the wrong things.

John: So do you love him?

Gabrielle: I do.

John: Well, then, why are we here? Why are we doing this?

Gabrielle: Because I don't wanna wake up one morning with a sudden urge to blow my brains out.

John: Hey, can I have a drag?

Gabrielle: Absolutelly not. You are much too young to smoke.
