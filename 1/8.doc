Susan: I wouldn't eat that if I were you.

Mike: Why?

Susan: I made it. Trust me. Hey, do you have a death wish?

Mike: No, I just refuse to believe that anybody can screw up macaroni and cheese. 
  Oh my god. How did you...? It tastes like it's burnt and undercooked.      

Susan: Yeah, I get that a lot. Here you go.

Mike: Thanks, I'm Mike Delfino. I just started renting the Sims' house next door.

Susan: Susan Mayer. I live across the street.

Mike: Oh yeah, Mrs. Huber told me about you, said you illustrate children's books.

Susan: Yeah, I'm very big with the under-five set. What do you do?

Mike: Plumber. So if you ever have a clog... or something.

Susan: Now that everybody's seen that I brought something.
       I should probably just throw this out.
