Bree: Susan, I was just saying Paul wants us to go over on Friday.
      He needs us to go through Mary Alice's closet and help pack up her things.
      He says he can't face doing it by himself.

Susan: Sure, That's fine.        

Bree: Are you ok?

Susan: Yeah, I'm just so angry. If Mary Alice was having problems,
       she should have come to us. She should've let us help her.

Gabrielle: What kinds of problems could she have had? She was healthy,
           had a great home, a nice family, her life was...

Lynette: Our life.

Gabrielle: No. If Mary Alice was having some sort of crisis, we'd have known.
           She lives 50 feet away, for God's sake.

Susan: Gabby, the woman killed herself. Something must've been going on.
