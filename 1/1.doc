My name is Mary Alice Young.

When you read this morning's paper, 
you may come across an article about the unusual day I had last week.

Normally, there's never anything newsworthy about my life,
but that all changed last thursday.

Of course, everything seemed quite normal at first.

I made breakfast for my family,
I performed my chores.
I completed my projects.
I ran my errands. 

In truth, I spent the day as I spent every other day,
quietly polishing the routine of my life until it gleamed with perfection.

That's why it was so astonishing when 
I decided to go to my hallway closet 
and retrieve a revolver that had never been used.

My body was discovered by my neighbor, Mrs. Martha Huber, 
who'd been startled by a strange popping sound.

Her curiosity aroused, 
Mrs. Huber tried to think of a reason for dropping in on me unannounced.

After some initial hesitation, 
she decided to return the blender she had borrowed from me six months before.

Mrs. Huber: It's my neighbor. I think she's been shot. There's blood everywhere.
            Yesï¼Œyou've got to send an ambulance.
            you've got to send one right now.

And for a moment, Mrs. Huber stood motionless in her kitchen,           
grief-stricken by this senseless tragedy.
But, only for a moment.

If there was one thing Mrs. Huber was known for,
It was her ability to look on the bright side.
