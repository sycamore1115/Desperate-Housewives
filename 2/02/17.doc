Dr. Goldfine: Bree, Rex just called. He won't be able to meet you here today, apparently, there was a emergency at the hospital.

Bree: Oh, Well, I wish he'd called me.

Dr. Goldfine: He suggested perhaps you'd like to meet with me by yourself? You've been very quiet in our joint sessions.

Bree: What? No, thank you. I have some things that I need to do today.

Dr. Goldfine: Are you sure? 

Bree: Yeah, I'm sure. 

Dr. Goldfine: Ok.

Bree: Dr. Goldfine, there is something you can do for me.

Dr. Goldfine: What's that? 

Bree: Take off your coat.
