Gabrielle: So now you're taking Julie on your dinner date with Mike?

Susan: Yeah, Well, if Edie is gonna be there, I'm gonna need emotional support.

Gabrielle: I can't believe she wormed her way in. How did you let her do that?

Susan: I don't know, I was goona to take her out at the knees, but it all happened so fast.

Gabrielle: Well, you know what you need to do. You need to get there early, spend a little time with Mike before the little barracuda gets there.

Susan: That's a good idea, Edie will get there at 5:45, which means her breasts will arrive at 5:30, so I should shoot for 5:00.

Gabrielle: That a girl. I'm just ganna take these upstairs.

Susan: I'm gonna keep my one litter bag and go home. That is a beautiful rose, Where did you get it.

Gabrielle: Oh, John gave it to me.

Susan: John? Your gardener, he gave you a rose?

Gabrielle: Yes, I am having some new bushes planted outside, and he gave me that as a color palette.

Susan: Oh, ok, sure is beautiful, isn't it?

Gabrielle: Yes, it is.
