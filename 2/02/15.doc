Huber: Susan, have you been able to find old clothes for Edie? She has nothing to wear.

Susan: I thought that was the look she was going for.

Huber: Oh, Susan, Edie may be trash, but she is still a human being.

Susan: Zach, is your dad home? I need to talk to him. Hi, Paul, I hope I'm not interrupting.

Paul: Actually, I was getting ready to go somewhere.

Susan: I just wanted to come by and say hello. You know, see how you guys are doing.

Paul: We're trying to move on, it's been pretty tough.

Susan: I can only imagine. Not knowing why Mary Alice... 

Paul: Why what?  

Susan: Why she did it. Oh, let me help you.

Paul: I got it. I've got it. 

Susan: I'm sorry if I upset you.

Paul: Can I be frank? 

Susan: Of course. 

Paul: I don't care what her reasons were . Maybe she was depressed, maybe she was bored, it dosen't matter. 
      She abandoned her husband and her son, and I'll never forgive her.

As I watched Susan, I couldn't help felling sorry for her. She wanted so much to know why I did it, why I killed myself.
It's not enough to want the truth, you must know where to look for it. And the truth is elusive, because it knows where to hide.
