Bree: And so there's just the four of us. My older son, Andrew, is 16, Danielle is 15 and...

Dr. Goldfine: I don't need to see pictures. Bree, you've spent most of the hour engaging in small talk.

Bree: Oh, have I?

Dr. Goldfine: Yes, Rex has been very vocal about his issues. Don't you want to discuss your feelings about your marriage?

Rex: This is the thing you got to know about Bree. She doesn't like to talk about her feelings.
     To be honest, it's hard to know if she has any. Does she feel anger, rage, ecstasy? Who knows?
     She's always pleasant, and I can't tell you how annoying that is. Whatever she feels, it's so far below the surface, no one can see it.
     I feel like she's using all these domestic things.. 

Dr. Goldfine: Bree? Would you like to respond to what Rex just said? Is there some truth there? 
              Do you use housework as a way to disengage emotionally?

Bree: Of course not!
