John: This is great. I got tons of homework tonight. It's easy to concentrate after do it.

Gabrielle: I'm glad I could help. Education's very important.

John: Oh, I got something for you. I was gonna give it to you next time I mowed your lawn, but since you're here.

Gabrielle: Oh, it's rose.

John: It's not just any rose. Look at all the petals, there's no flaws. It's perfect. Just like you.
      I spent days looking for just the right one. I finally found it.

The truth hit her like a thunderbolt. For John, this was no longer a meaningless little affair. 
Gabrielle could now clearly see he was falling in love with her.

Gabrielle: It's just beatiful. I got to go.
