Lynette: Boys! Guys, I'm begging you. Sit in your seats. I'm not gonna tell you again. Buckle up. 
        I mean it, so help me... Oh, Crap!

Police: License and registration, please. Ma'am, you know why I pulled you over?         

Lynette: I have a theory.

Police: The kids are jumping up and down, they should be sitting, wearing seat belts.

Lynette: I yelled at them. They never listen to me. It's very frustrating.

Police: You’re gonna hafta find a way to control them. After all, that's your job.

Though he'd been a policeman for six years, officer Hayes had never found himself in a truly dangerous situation.

Lynette: You saying I'm a bad mother? 

Police: Ma’am, you need to get back in your car please. 

Lynette: I have no help. My husband's always away on business. 

Police: I'm gonna have to ask you to step back now.

Lynette: My babysitter joined the witness relocation program. I haven't slept through the night in six years.
         And for you to stand there and judge me.

Police: Ok. I'm not gonna give you a ticket. I'm just gonna let you off with a warning.        

Lynette: I accept your apology.

Police: Buckle up.
