Susan: Hey, you. What are we having?

Mike: I talked to Julie and she suggested rib-eye steaks. She said that's your favorite.

Susan: I love my steak.

Mike: Edie, Hey, I'm sorry about your house. How you holding up?

Edie: All right, I guess. Oh, is somebody having a party?

Mike: No, Susan's just throwing me one of her traditional welcome-to-the-neighborhood dinners. Only I'm cooking, and having it at my house.

Edie: Traditional? I didn't get one.

Susan: Oh, it's sort of a new tradition.

Mike: It won't be anything fancy. Just a little home cooking.

Edie: That sounds so good. I've been having nothing but fast food lately.

Susan suddenly had an awful feeling in the pit of her stomach. As if she was watching an accident in slow motion.
She knew it would happen, but was powerless to stop it.

Susan: Edie, would you like to join us for dinner?

Edie: Oh, that's so sweet. No, I don't want to intrude, three's a crowd.

Mike: No, it's not like that. I mean, Susan's bringing Julie.

Susan: It's not like that. The more the merrier.

Edie: Well, this will be fun. 

Mike: All right, tomorrow night. We'll eat at six.

Edie: Great. Oh, Susan, this'll make up for the dinner that you never threw me.

Mike: Should I have told her we were having steak? She's not a vegetarian or something else?

Susan: Oh, no. Edie's definitely a carnivore.
