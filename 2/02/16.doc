Huber: Hello, Julie. I talked to you mom about donating some clothes for Edie.

Julie: She's at Mrs. Van De Kamp's. But I'll see if she left some stuff upstairs.

Huber: Oh, Julie. I was just admiring your new measuring cup.

Julie: Yeah, we've lose ours.

Huber: Really?

Julie: So I couldn't find the clothes, I'm sorry.

Huber: That's ok.

Julie: If you want me to keep looking? 

Huber: No, you've done more than enough. Truly.
