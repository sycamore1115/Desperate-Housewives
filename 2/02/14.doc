Lynette: Here's what I pulled for Edie. I should warn you, the most of the clothes in there aren't that stylish.

Huber: don't worry about it. Edie's a beggar now, which means she can't be a chooser. Of course, we don't have to add salt to the wound.

Lynette: Listen, I was just getting dinner ready...

Huber: Say no more. I'll get out of your hair. By the way, was that you I saw getting pulled over by a policeman?

Lynette: Yeah, the boys were acting up in the car, I couldn't get them to sit down.

Huber: Young boys can be so willful.

Lynette: I try everything. I scream, I threaten, I reason, I beg, nothing works. 
         I don't know if it's because they're too young and they don't understand, 
         or if they're just getting some perverse joy out of testing me.

Huber: My mother used to have the worst time with me in the car, so one time when I was acting up, 
       she stopped and left me on the side of the road, and she drove off.

Lynette: You're kidding.       

Huber: Oh, she came back immediately, but I never misbehaved in the car again. You should try that.

Lynette: Mrs. Huber, I could never leave my kids by the side of the road.

Huber: When it comes to discipline, sometimes you must be creative. My mother knew that, smart lady. 
       Of course, she's in a home now, and her mind has just turned to mush.

Lynette: Well, like I said, I should go back and get dinner ready.
