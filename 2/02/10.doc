John: Well, this is my room. Sorry about the mess.

Ganrielle: Oh, don't worry about it.

John: You just missed my mom. On friday, she coaches my little sister's soccer team.

Ganrielle: Yes, I heard that. John, we need to talk about what happened the other day.

John: Mr. Solis isn't catching on, is he?

Ganrielle: No, he doesn't have a clue, god love him. It's just I was thinking that when you come over to garden, you might actually have to garden.

John: Great, you're breaking up with me, in my own bedroom.

Ganrielle: No, I'm not dumping you. Lately, you've been the only thing keeping me going. But we can't do it at my house anymore.

John: Oh, so then, where do you want to do it?

Ganrielle: Well, what time does your mom get back from soccer practice? You better hurry, we don't have a lot of time.
