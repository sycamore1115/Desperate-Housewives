Edie: Hey, Susan, don't worry, Mike and I have got everything under control.

Mike: Bongo! I don't know why he barks at you.

Edie: I wouldn't take it personally, dogs are very sensitive. What's up, Bongo? You never know what freaks them out, huh?

Edie: Is it a strange noise? What is it? A werid smell?

Round one had started.
