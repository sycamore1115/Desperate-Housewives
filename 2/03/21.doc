Gabrielle: Oh my god, Carlos, what have you done?

Carlos: I thought Gabrielle would look so beautiful in this. Cost me an arm and a leg.
        It's got GPS navigation, 200 watt stereo system, rear parking sensors.

Gabrielle: God, it's beautiful.

Carlos: So did I take your breath away?

Gabrielle: Absolutely.

Carlos: Is it the best gift you've ever gotten?

Gabrielle could see what this gesture had cost Carlos, so she responded the only way she knew how.
She had a feling the truth would've been lost on her husband anyway.
After all, it's the rare man who understands the value of a single perfect rose.
