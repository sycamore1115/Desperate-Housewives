Mike: Bongo! Get down! DownÔºÅI'm sorry. So who's the guy that lives across from Mrs. Huber again?

Susan: That's Mr. Mullen. And just so you know, if he invites you in, you have to meet all of his pets.

Mike: That's ok, I love animals.

Susan: He is a taxidermist.

Mike: Oh, ok, thanks for the warning.

Edie: Isn't Mr. Mullen's brother your divorce attorney?

Susan: Yes, he was.

Edie: Can I say something? In my heart, I still believe that you and Carl are gonna get back together.

Mike: Really? 

Edie: Oh, yeah. I've never seen two people more in love. I mean, she's never gonna find that kind of chemistry with another man, never.

It was everything Susan could do to keep a smile on her face, round two was underway, and she was already taking a beating.
What Eide hadn't counted on, Susan had somesone in her corner.

Julie: You know what, Mrs. Britt, Do you know Who I always liked? Mr. Rothwell, your fourth husband.

Edie: He was my second husband, I've only been married twice.

Julie: Twice? You weren't married to the guy with all the tattoos that they took away in handcuffs?

Susan: No, julie, she wasn't married to Javier, that was just one of her special friends. I think we should change the subject.
       You know, unless you want to keep taking about it.

Mike: Bongo, get down.       

Edie: Wait, let me show you something. He loves that gravy. Come, while you were in there tossing a salad, I taught him something.

Susan was furious with Edie for using a dog to ingratiate herself with its owner.
She was also furious with Mike for not seeing through this blatant maneuver. 
But mostly she was furious with herself for not having thought of it first.

Susan: so, you know what? I'm gonna go get the desserts.

Mike: I can barely get him to sit. I've never seen him walk on two legs.

Edie: He knows who to come to.

Susan: Here's your dessert.

Edie: Thank you, Mike, this looks yummy.

Mike: Oh, look at that, looks like bongo's finally warming up to Susan.

Susan: Oh, we just got off on the wrong foot, we're best buddies now. Oh, what a good boy! Bongo, are you ok?

Edie: What's wrong with him?

Mike: I don't know, I've never heard him make that sound. Are you ok, fella?

Julie: Mom? Where is your earring?

Mike: Call the vet, the number's on the fridge, tell him I'll be right there.

Edie: Ok, don't worry about a thing. I'll stay here and get everything cleaned up.

Mike: Thanks, Edie.

Susan: Is there anything I can do?

Mike: No.
