Susan: How's Bongo doing?

Mike: I'm waiting to see if they'll have to operate.

Susan: Oh, god. I stopped and I got this for... I'm just so sorry for this.

Mike: I'm really sorry I snapped at you. I just...

Susan: Oh, no, it's ok.

Doctor: Good news, we won't have to do surgery.

Susan: Oh, that's great.

Doctor: We've given Bongo somthing to help pass the earring. When he does, would you like us to retrieve it for you?

Susan: I'm gonna say no.

Doctor: Ok, you should be able to take him home in about an hour.

Susan: Wow, You must be so relieved.

Mike: I'm sorry, I was just really worried.

Susan: It was your dog, I get it.

Mike: Actually, he was my wife's dog, and one of the last thing she said to me in the hospital before she died was to be sure I looked after him,
      and I promised her I would. 
      He meant so much to her. 
      And if something had happened, I would've felt like I'd failed her. I know that sounds stupid, but...

And just like that, Susan could suddenly see something she'd never seen before.
Mike Delfino was still in love with his late wife.
And she knew right then, neither she nor Edie would be laying claim to his heart any time soon.
So she decided, for now, she could settle for just being his friend.

Susan: No, it doesn't, not at all. This is for you, well, for Bongo, you give it to him.

Yes, as I look back at the world I left behind, it's all so clear to me. 
the beauty that waits to be unveiled, the mysteries that long to be uncovered. 
But people so rarely stop to take a look, they just keep moving. It's a shame, really, There's so much to see.
