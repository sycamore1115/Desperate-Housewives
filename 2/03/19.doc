Dr. Goldfine: I'm sure Freud would not approve of this.

Bree: Oh, who cares what he thinks? I took psychology in college, we learned all about Freud, A miserable human being.

Dr. Goldfine: What makes you say that?

Bree: Well, think about it, he grew up in the late 1800s, there were no appliances back then, his mother had to do everything by hand,
      just backbreaking work from sunup to sundown, not to mention the countless other sacrifices she probably had to make to take care of her family.
      And what does he do? 
      He grows up and becomes famous, peddling a theory that the problems of most adults can be traced back to something awful their mother had done.
      She must've felt so betrayed. He saw how hard she worked, he saw what she did for him, Did he even ever think to say thank you?
      I dount it. There you go.

Dr. Goldfine: Just so you know, many of Freud's theories have been discredited.

Bree: Good.
