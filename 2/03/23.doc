Rex: Look, all I'm saying is that this whole it takes two to mess up a marriage theory is bull, 
     the problems that we have are because of her.

Bree: That is not true, Rex.

Rex: All right, fine. What have I been doing for the past 20 years that's been so awful? 
     You're not saying anything because I've been a great husband, and it kills you to admit that.

Dr. Goldfine: Rex, I'm curious, do you ever acknowledge the benifits of living with Bree?
              By your own admission, your home's always clean, your clothes always freshly pressed, sounds like a wonderful cook,
              despite her flaws, do you ever remember to say thank you?
