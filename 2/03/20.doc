Lynette: boys, I am not gonna tell you again, sit. I mean it, I am serious.
         You guys are gonna be in so much trouble if you don't sit back in those seats.

For the first time, Lynette could see this was not the innocent play of children, she was being challenged.
So she decided it was time to get creative.

Lynette: Out! Can't behave, you heard me, you cannot ride. you, out, move it.

Children: Where is she going?

Lynette: Ok, mommy is a genius, five, six, all right. Uh, mommy will be right back.
         Boys? If you're hidding, you've got to stop now, cause mommy doesn't think it's funny. 
         Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm looking for my boys, three boys with red hair, have you seen them?

Lady: Yeah, I also saw you drive away and leave them.        

Lynette: I knowï¼ŒI was just trying to scare them into behaving, did you see where they went?

Lady: Yeah, they're in my kitchen, listen, it seems to me that you have some anger management issues.

Lynette: I have four kids under the age of six, I absolutely have anger management issues.

Lady: I think you need to talk to somebody because abandoning your children.

Lynette: I didn't abandon them, I came back.

Lady: I'm just saying it's not normal.

Lynette: Well. my kids aren't normal, and now I don't have time for this, lady. So, boys, get out here.

Lady: I don't think they should go anywhere until you calm down.

Lynette: Get in the car.

Children: She's got cookies.

Lynette: Well, bring them, we're leaving.

Lady: No, stay put.

Lynette: Oh, I don't think so.

Lady: Listen, lady, you and I are gonna talk.

Children: Leave my mommy alone.

Lynette: Let go of me. What's the matter with you? Run, boys, run! Come on! Oh, crap.

Lynette: Boys, you're gonna need to put on your...

Lady: You get back here. Get back or I'm gonna call social services.
