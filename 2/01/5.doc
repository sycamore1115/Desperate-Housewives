Carlos: I know you're awake.

Gabrielle: I know you're a jerk.

Carlos: Dinner with Tanaka ran long. I'm sorry.

Gabrielle: You know, Carlos, I didn't marry you so I could have dinner by myself six times a week. You know how bored I was today?
           I came this close to actually cleaning the house.

Carlos: Don't be that way. I got you a gift.           

Gabrielle: Nope. You're not going to buy your way out of this one.

Carlos: It's a good gift.

Gabrielle: Is that white gold?

Carlos: Yeah. Put it on and then make love to me.

Gabrielle: I'm not in the mood. But we could stay up and talk.

Carlos: When a man buys a woman expensive jewelry, there are many things he may want in return, for future reference,
        conversation ain't one of them. Hey, that was a joke. What the hell is wrong with you? 

Gabrielle: Let go of me.

Carlos: You've been acting like a nightmare for a month. What's wrong? I can't fix it unless you tell me.

Gabrielle: It's not exciting anymore, Carlos.

Carlos: So what am I supposed to do? 

Gabrielle: I don't know. Be the way you used to be. Surprise me. Take my breath away.

Carlos: Okay.
