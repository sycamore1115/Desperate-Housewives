Edie: It's all gone. Everything my ex-husband worked for all those years, gone.

Huber: Don't worry about clothing. I already started a collection from people in the neighborhood.

Edie: What? I don't want to wear other people's old crap.

Huber: Edie, you can be homeless or you can be ungracious. You really can't afford to be both.

Edie: That reminds me. My insurance check still hasn't come yet. Could I stay with you a few more weeks?

Huber: Of course. What kind of Christian would I be if I denied shelter to a friend in need?
       Oh, look. Here's something we can salvage. Your measuring cup. We can scrape off the burnt part and it'll look good as new.

Edie: That's not my cup. Mine was plastic.       

Huber: Well, how did it get in here?

Edie: I don't know. Who cares? Now, could you put that down and start looking for jewelry?
