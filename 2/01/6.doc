Mike: Hey, Susan. What's wrong.

Susan: I didn't realize anybody was going to be out here. I just sort of rolled out of bed.

Mike: I'm sure you look fine. Oh, Bongo, stop. Sorry, he scares easy.

Susan: No, it's fine. I get it.

Mike: I didn't mean to distrub you. I'll see you later.

Susan: Do you want to have dinner with me? 

Mike: Just the two of us? 

Susan: Well, and Julie. It's a thing we do when somebody new moves into the neighborhood, we invite them over for a home-cooked meal.
       Sort of a tradition.

Mike: I thought you were a lousy cook.       

Susan: Well, I order take-out.

Mike: You invite them for home-cooking and give them take-out?

Susan: Yeah, it's sort of a new tradition. I'm working out the kinks.

Mike: I'll tell you what. How about I cook? And you guys come over to my place. Friday night at six?

Susan: Oh, great. I'll be there. By, Bongo.

Susan: JUlie! Mike Delfino just invited us to dinner Friday night.

Julie: He did? Cool.

Susan: But only I'm going because you're gonna come down with something serious that requires bed rest an fluids.

Julie was glad Susan was rekindling her love life. Of course, she was unaware of her mother's recent track record with fire.
