Susan awoke that night alone and parched, but as she gazed out her window, 
she saw the tall drink of water she needed to quinch her thirst.

Julie: "Dear diary, Mike doesn't even know I'm alive."

Susan: Shut up.

Julie: If you want to date him, you're going to have to ask him out.

Susan: I keep hoping he'll ask me out.

Julie: How's that going?

Susan: Shouldn't you be making brownies for your nerdy friends?

Julie: I can't find the measuring cup. Have you seen it?

Susan: The measuring cup? Well, it's got to be here somewhere. Just keep looking.
