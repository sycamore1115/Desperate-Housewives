Rex: It's ok. I'm up.

Bree: Good. I have a question for you. Do you remember when you proposed?

Rex: For god's sake.

Bree: We sat on Skyline Drive and drank a bottle of apple wine, and when we finished it, you turned to me, and you said, 
      "if you marry me, Bree Mason, I promise to love you for the rest of my life." And even though I was engaged to Ty Grant,
      and even though my father didn't like you, I said yes.

Rex: That was a long time ago.      

Bree: You're going to cancel the meeting with that divorce lawyer, and we're going to find ourselves a marriage counselor.
      You promiesd.

Rex: All right.      

Bree: Good. I'm going to go, uh, make myself some warm milk. Would you like something to drink?

Rex: Anything but apple wine.
