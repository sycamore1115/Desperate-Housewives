An odd thing happens when we die. Our senses vanish. 
Taste, touch, smell, and sound become a distant memory, but our sight -- ah, our sight expands.
And we can suddenly see the world we've left behind so clearly.
Of course, most of what's visible to the dead could also be seen by the living, if they only take the time to look.

Like my friend Gabrielle, I should have seen how unhappy she was, but I didn't.
I only saw her clothes from Paris, and her platinum jewelry, and her brand-new diamond watch.
Had I looked closer, I'd have seen that Gabrielle was a drowning woman. desperately in search of a life raft. 
Luckily for her, she found one. Of course, Gabrielle only saw her young gardener as a way to infuse her life with a little excitement.
But now she was about to discover just how exciting her life could get.

Gabrielle: Damn it. Come on! Hurry up! Let's go.

John: where are the rest of my clothes?

Gabrielle: I'll find them. Just get out. Out the window. ... Hey, honey. You're home early.

Carlos: My meeting got canceled. Didn't you take a shower this morning?

Gabrielle: I just finished a workout.

Carlos: Where's John? That's his truck out front.

Gabrielle was panicked. She knew if her husband discovered her secret, she would feel the full force of his wrath.

John: Hey, Mr. Solis.

Carlos: Hey, John, did you take care of that ficus yet?

John: I'll get to it as soon as I'm done here.

Carlos: Alright. We need to talk about the hedges later. 

But she was quickly reminded that what Carlos couldn't see couldn't hurt her.
