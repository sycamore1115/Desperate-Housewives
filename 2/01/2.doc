The peaceful facade of Wisteria Lane had recently been shattered, first by my suicide.
And then by the discovery of a note among my belongings that suggested a suspicious reason for my desperate act.
My friends gathered to discuss its implications.

Susan: I think we should give it to Paul.

Gabrielle: He's still mourning, Susan. He'll probably freak out.

Susan: It doesn't matter. She was his wife. He deserves to have all the facts.

Bree: Well, we could do it gently.  We could tell him about it over coffee and pastry.

Lynette: That would be fun. "Paul, we have proof your wife killed herself over some deep, dark secert. Another bear claw?"

Gabrielle: We could always call the police.

Lynette: Maybe it's just some sort of sick joke.

Bree: Well, if it was a joke, it was in very poor taste.

Susan: No, this was serious. I know it was. We got to find out what was going on.

Lynette: Let's say we do. There's a chance we're not going to like what we find.

Susan: Well, isn't it worse to be in the dark? I mean, imagining she did all these horrible things.

Bree: It's the age-old question. isn't it? How much do we really want to know about our neighbors?

My friends were right to be concerned. They knew that every family has its secrets, 
and as my son and husband could have told them, you need to think carefully before digging them up.

After talking for hours, my friends still hadn't agreed on what to do with the note.
So they decided to talk about it in the morning after a good night's rest. But no one could fall asleep that night.
They each kept thinking of my suicide and how terribly alone I must have felt. 
You see, loneliness was something my friends understood all too well.
