Bree: Private sessions? I don't understand, why do we need private sessions?

Dr. Goldfine: Private sessions allow us to work on the personal issues of both partners. 

Bree: Oh, I don't have any personal issues, my only issue is that my husband wants to leave me,
      and how can I work on that if he is not in the room?

Rex: There are things I need to discuss with Dr. Goldfine, and I can't have you there.

Bree: Why? I'm your wife, you can say anything in front of me. All we need is a few more sessions, and I'm sure we can...

Rex: Damn it, Bree, a few more sessions is not gonna fix us, this is bigger than that.

Dr. Goldfine: Why don't we do it this way? Rex, you can take the first half-hour, Bree, you can take the second.

Bree: Fine, oh, and doctor, if what he is about to discuss has anything to do with adultery, prostitution, or internet pornography, 
      I would really appreciate you taking a moral hard line.
