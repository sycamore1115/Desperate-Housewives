Gabrielle: Hey, Ashley, remember me? We met earlier. Wow, aren't you the little artist? What are those, flamingos?

Ashley: No.

Gabrielle: What a very pretty! It almost looks like they are kissing, funny thing about kissing, It's not just for husbands and wives, 
           sometimes we kiss our mom or our grandpa, sometimes we even kiss our dog, sometimes we even kiss people who are just our friends,
           kind of like a high-five on the lips, right? Hey, Ash, I was at the mall, and I saw this, I thought you might like it. 
           She is Hawaiian, Her name is princess Kahalua, and I think it means "little waterfall" or "big pond" or something.
           Ok, so we are good, right? Well, you enjoy your new little friend, and if there's anything else you need, you just let me know.

Ashley: What I'd really like is a bike.
