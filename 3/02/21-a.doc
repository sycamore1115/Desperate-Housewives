As the sun slowly settled on Wisteria Lane, an unsettled Susan racked her brain to find a way into her own house. 
Lying naked in her shrubs, it occurred to Susan this could be the most humiliating moment of her life -- she was wrong.

Mike: Susan? Whatcha doing?

Susan: Locked myself out, nacked, and then I fell. 

Mike: So how are you? Good, it just got back, I've been gone all day, and I got your messages about dinner, 
      and I would love to come if that invite still stands.

Susan: It's a date.

Mike: All right, I assume the dress is casual.

Susan: Yeah, it's casual.
