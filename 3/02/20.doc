Susan: I'm coming, Carl, what are you doing here? I asked you to come tomorrow.

Carl: You said you wanted to talk, it sounded important.

Susan: Tomorrow, I'm in a towel.

Carl: We were married 14 years, I know what's under there, come on.

Susan: I'm not really ready for this. I was gonna have a whole speech prepared.

Carl: Brandi and I have plans tomorrow, I suggest you wing it. 

Susan: Ok, here's the thing, Carl, I was thinking about what happened in the driveway yesterday, and I just don't want to... 
       I don't want to live like that, I don't want to be that kind of person, and I just thought if two of us, you know,  
       if we had a nice, clam... I need an apology, Carl.

Carl: What?

Susan: An apology, for the way you ended our marriage, you never took any responsibility for your behavior.

Carl: I don't know what to say, Susan, the heart wants what it wants.

Susan: What does that mean?

Carl: I fell in love.

Susan: While you were married to someone else.

Carl: The heart wants what it wants.

Susan: My hearts wants to hurt you, but I can control myself.

Carl: I don't want to go back to that ugly place, really, and if you do, I suggest that you get some help.

Susan: You know what? I don't need an apology, I don't need anything from you.

Carl: You're humiliating yourself.

Susan: No, you're the one who's been humiliated, why don't you say that? You walked out on your family, people think your're scum, not me, 
      so worry about yourself, I'm ok with me, I can walk down the street and hold my head high.
