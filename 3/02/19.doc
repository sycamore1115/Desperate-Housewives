Gabrielle: Don't look at the your feet, look at the road, find your balance, it's all you, you're doing great. 
           Ok, stay to the right, watch the car! Are you ok? 

Ashley: Yeah, Let's go again.

Gabrielle: Honey, these heels don't have another block in them.

Ashley: What about tomorrow?

Gabrielle: You won't be around tomorrow, 'cause you have school.

Ashley: I'm homeschooled, I'm always around.

It was in that moment that Gabrielle realized this ride was far from over.
