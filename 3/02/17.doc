After her talk with Lynette, Susan decided to take a look at her old photo album, and she bagan to see herself in a whole new light,
and the picture wasn't flattering.

Carl: Yeah, you got Carl, leave a message.

Susan: Hey, Carl, it's me. I was hoping you would be there, listen, we need to talk, so maybe when you drop Julie off tomorrow, 
       we can have a moment. It's important, give my best to Brandi, call me.

Susan was proud of herself, she was finally ready to let go of her anger, well, almost.
