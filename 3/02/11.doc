Tom: It's a business meeting.

Lynette: It's a frat party.

Tom: Regional manager, coporate manage, head of sales.

Lynette: Margarita, cigar, sombrero.

Tom: Honey, what do you want me to do, sit around the hotel the whole time watching cable?

Lynette: No, when I say we've been invited to a party, don't your whine about your exhausting 60-hour week,
         put on your dancin' shoes and take the mother of your children out for a good time.

Tom: Fine, you know what? you're right. Let's go to that party.

Lynette: I can't, I already canceled the sitter.

Tom: Ok, we'll throw a next one.

Lynette: Throw a dinner party? I don't even have time to wash my face.
         No, you know what? I'm gonna go to this one, you can stay home and babysit the kids.

Tom: Fine, I can hanle that.
