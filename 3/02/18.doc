Lynette: The boys will be hungry at 5:30, so put the fish sticks in the toaster oven at 5:00 o'clock.

Tom: For half an hour, honey, I know, this is the third time you've told me.

Lynette: Well, if the food's late, god help you.

Tom: Beatiful, I don't need a pamphlet, it's not brain surgery, they're just kids, for god sake.

Lynette: Preston, would you come here? Sweetie, you know our rule about eating cookies, right?

Preston: Yeah, we can't have them after 5:00, cause sugar makes us hyper.

Lynette: Yeah, but tonight, anything goes. Make sure you share with your brothers.
