Bree: So where are you going?

Rex: I'll be staying at the motor lodge.

Bree: The hotel by the interstate has better rates, and it's closer to your work.

Rex: Fine.

Bree: I'm packing your swimsuit. There's a pool there, and I know how swimming relaxes you.

Rex: When our kids ask where I am, what are you gonna say?

Bree: I could tell them that you went to tennis camp, that was a joke.

Rex: Yeah, I got it.

Bree: Obviously, if you've forgotten anything, you can come right back and get it.

Rex: Well, I'll call you.

Bree: Rex, in college, when we first started dating, people were so jealous of us, we were the golden couple,
      everybody knew we were going to have this wonderful life, why is this happening?

Rex: Because you can't even let me pack my own suitcase.
