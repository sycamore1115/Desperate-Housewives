Carlos: So Gabrielle says that you and Bree are taking lessons three times a week.
        I'm actually thinking about playing again, I mean, it's such great exercise.

Rex: Mm, That it is.

Carlos: And my drop shot could use a serious tune-up, Think you can give me the number of your pro? 

Rex: Yeah, I'll give it to you later.

Carlos: Well, what club does he work out for?

Rex: We are not really taking tennis lessons, Carlos.

Carlos: You're not?

Rex: That's a store, Bree concocted to cover the fact that we're seeing a marriage counselor.
     Bree, he wouldn't stop asking about the tennis pro. 
     Bree and I are in marriage counseling, everyone knows our secret now, did the sky fall? Has your life come crashing down? 

Bree: If everybody would please take your seats, dinner is served.
