Lynette: How was your night?

Tom: We are raising little terrorists. You know that, don't you?

Lynette: Oh, you didn't have a good time?

Tom: You know what? Drop the act, I know you gave them cookies.

Lynette: Oh, who cracked, anyway.

Tom: Porter. So how was your dinner party?

Lynette: Well, there was dinner, but it wasn't much of a party.

Tom: Oh, what happened?

Lynette: I don't know, Rex announced that he and Bree are in counseling, she retaliated with this whole revelation 
         which I won't even go into now, and the bottom line is he stormed out. Clearly, there's trouble in paradise.

Tom: Honestly, I'm not that surprised.

Lynette: Why not.

Tom: I don't know, I just never got the idea that they were really happy.

Lynette: Are we happy?
