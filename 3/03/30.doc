Julie: Where are you going?

Susan: Just a sec. Don't worry, I'm not packing heat. Hey, Brandi, would you scoot a little? Just scoot, thank you.

Carl: What are you doing?

Susan: I'll be quick. Brandi, I'm sorry for the way I treated you. It was uncalled for childish, and it won't happen again.
       I have built up a lot of anger towards you, both of you. And I realize now that I just can't carry that around anymore, 
       so apology or no apology, I'm moving on. 

Carl: Brandi, get in the car.

Brandi: Mrs. Mayer.

Susan: Please, call me Susan.

Brandi: I just wanted you to know what happened between me and Carl, things got out of hand, because I thought your marriage was over.
        Anyway, I just wanted you to know I'm sorry, I really am.

Susan: Thank you.        

And though it came from an unexpected source, Susan finally got the apology she'd always wanted.
