Susan: Thanks for helping me break in, do you think it'll be hard to replace that screen?

Mike: It depends, if you nail it in yourself, you might want to wear gloves or pants, pants wouldn't hurt.

Susan: Ok, I know what just happened is funny in theory, but I'm nowhere near ready to laugh about it, so please, no jokes.

Bree: Hey, where have you two been?

Mike: Susan had a problem finding something to wear. Oh, is that the kind of thing you meant?

Susan: Pretty much.

Lynette: The kids are bouncing off the walls? I'm sure you can figure a way to put them to bed, Tom.
         I mean for god's sake, Tom, they're just kids.

Susan: Hey, are you ok?         

Gabrielle: Yeah, I went jogging today, and I think I just pushed myself too hard.

Susan: Oh, you're probably not wearing the right shoes.

Gabrielle: Yeah, that thought did cross my mind.
