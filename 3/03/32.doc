Dr. Goldfine: Bree, we're not scheduled now, are we?

Bree: I didn't have time to make an appoinment. Rex moved out today.

Dr. Goldfine: I'm very sorry to hear that, but unfortunately, I'm completely booked right now.

Bree: I don't need much time, it just seems that you have more insight into my situation than I do, and I just think...

Dr. Goldfine: We can't talk now.

Bree: If you could just tell me what he told you, then I could fix the problem.

Dr. Goldfine: I can't do that, it's completely unethical.

Bree: Why can't you ...

Dr. Goldfine: That's my next appointment, you really need to go.

Bree: Dr. Goldfine, please.

Dr. Goldfine: Hold on, I'll go and talk to my client.

Bree searched for Rex's audiotape hoping to find answers, she found answers alright, but to entirely different questions.

Dr. Goldfine: I understand completely, I'll be out in just a minute.
              Bree, I'm sorry, he can't wait. But I can see you first thing in the morning, eight o'clock.
 
Bree: eight o'clock, sorry to interupt, bye.

Yes, I remember the world -- every detail, and what I remember most is how I afraid I was, What a waste.
You see, to live in fear is not to live at all. I wish I could tell this to those I left behind, but would it do any good? Probably not.
I understand now, there will always be those who face their fears, and there will always be those who run away.
