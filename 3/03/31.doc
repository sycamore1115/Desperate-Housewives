Tom: Hey, let me take those.

Lynette: You're wearing a really big hat.

Tom: Yes, I am. Listen, the kids are watching a video, which means that we've got only about 45 minutes until they actually find Nemo,
     so, I suggest that we make the most of it.

Lynette: By reliving your night out with the guys?

Tom: Lynette, I'm trying.

Lynette: You look ridiculous in that thing.

Tom: Sexy ridiculous? 

Lynette: Maybe.

Tom: I can live with maybe. 

Lynette: You know, It's gonna take more than just this one night.

Tom: I know. Looks like we have an audience.

Lynette: Let them look, as long as they don't try and cut in.
