Susan: Ok, I got to break the ice here, so you're in counseling, big deal, you want humiliation? I'll give you humiliation.
       I locked myself out of my house stark naked and got caught by Mike.

Gabrielle: Oh my god, when did this happen?

Susan: Today, right before the party.

Mike: What can I say, right place right time.

Lynette: I think I can top that, try getting thrown out of Disneyland for lewd behavior.

Susan: What? When was this?

Lynette: When Tom and I were first married, things got a little out of hand on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. 

Rex: You're kidding.

Lynette: No, we got perp walked down main street, USA.

Gabrielle: Well, since we're doing true confessions, Carlos and I once broke a waterbed in Cancoon. 

Mike: How did you manage that?

Gabrielle: Well, he used to have a thing for spiked heels.

Carlos: I'd just like to make it clear -- she was wearing them.

Bree: Rex cries after that.
