Mike: You think we left too early?

Susan: I was thinking we left too late.

Mike: So, is Rex gone for good? 

Susan: I don't know, god I hope not. I mean, they've always been wound a little tight, but I've never seen them like that.
       Then again, who am I to judge?

Mike: You mean people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw soda cans?

Susan: Ok, you've got to know that I only get that angry around Carl, he just treated me so badly at the end.
       I haven't been able to get past it.

Mike: Maybe he did you a big favor.

Susan: What do you mean?

Mike: Let's look at Carl as a starter marriage, you know, boot camp, preparing you for something better next time.

Susan: Listen, Mike, about the whole seeing me naked thing, I just want to thank you for being such a perfect gentleman

Mike: Oh, I wasn't a perfect gentleman, I might have snuck a peek.

Susan: Oh, good night.

Mike: And for what it's worth, Wow.
