Lynette: So did Mike say anything? 

Susan: No, but god, you should have seen the look on his face.

Lynette: I'm sure it's not that bad, I mean, he's coming to the party, right?

Susan: I left three messages. Oh, he's not going to come, big surprise. I did everything but foam at the mouth, god, I hate when I get that way.
         It's like every time I get within 10 feet of Carl, I just become this monster.

Lynette: You know what? It's not going to change until you resolve your issues with that man.          

Susan: What, you mean forgive them? You know, I've lived with this bitterness so long, I think I'd be lonely without it.

Lynette: Honey, get a pet, see ya.
