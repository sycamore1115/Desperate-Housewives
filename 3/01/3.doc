Lynette: Hey, I know, her dinner.

Susan: How could we have all forgotten about this?

Lynette: We didn't exactly forget, it's just usually when the hostess dies the party is off.
         I'm not being flip, I'm just pointing out a reality.

Gabrielle: Mary Alice was so excited about it, it's so sad.

Susan: I think we should go through with it.

Bree: Really? Wouldn't that be in poor taste?

Susan: No, it's sort of a way to honor Mary Alice, it was so important to her.

Gabrielle: We could all use a fun night.

Bree: Well, good, because I have some new flour that I have been just dying to show off.

Lynette: I'm in.

Bree: I'll make braised lamb shanks.

Lynette: I'm still in.

Bree: So how many I will be cooking for?

Gabrielle: Seven, three couples and Susan, does that sounds right?

Susan: No, it sounds very, very wrong.

Bree: Is there somebody you'd like to invite?

Susan: I have an idea.
