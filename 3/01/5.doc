Tom: A dinner partyï¼Ÿ

Lynette: Yeah, it'll be fun. Bree's cooking, everyone's coming.

Tom: You know what? I haven't even had a chance to unpack yet, honey, I just need to chill out for the next few days.

Lynette: Oh, Tom, there'll be liquor and hors doeuveres and grownups without children and silverware, remeber silverware?

Tom: Honey, can you take this in for me?

Lynette: Have you heard anything I just said?

Tom: Yeah, I'm sorry, I just, I'm wiped out. Three cities in six days, my head is just pounding, I'm not ready for a dinner party.

Lynette: I already got a sitter.

Tom: Can you cancel her? Please? Look, let's just stay in tomorrow night, we can get a bottle of wine and rent a video,
     and I just want to hang out with my best gal. That's all.

Lynette: I was looking so forward to a night out.     

Tom: I know, sweetie, I'm sorry, but I'm beat. I mean, do you remeber what it was like to work a 60-hours week?
