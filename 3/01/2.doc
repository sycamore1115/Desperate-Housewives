The day on Wisteria Lane began like any other, with a cup of coffee and the morning paper.
And while Lynette read the business section, and Gabrielle studied the fall collections, and Bree searched for decorating ideas,
Susan scanned the front page and saw something that caught her eye.

Alice: What's about time.

Susan: Be nice, I come bearing snacks.

Bree: Lynette, these cards are sticky.

Lynette: I know, Preston used the three of diamonds to scoop jam out of the jar.

Gabrielle: Gorgeous, thankful we have 49 cards to play with.

Susan: Hello, sorry I'm late.

Alice: So, Susan, I was just telling the girls, I want to throw a dinner party.

Susan: Really? 

Alice: Yes, how long have we all lived on this street, we've never done a big group thing.

Bree: I think it's a great idea.

Alice: Paul never likes to have people over, but the heck with him, I'm doing it.

Susan: So, when is this shindig?

Alice: How about a month from tonight? That would be the 16th, good for everyone?

Bree: Works for me, should we all make something?

Alice: Oh no, this is my party, I've been wanting to have everyone over for years.
       I'm so happy we're finally doing this, it's gonna be so much fun.
