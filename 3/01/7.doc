Carl: A dinner partyï¼Ÿ

Susan: It's tomorrow night, so if you could just keep Julie an extra day.

Carl: Fine, but that's all, Brandi and I leave sunday for a week up at the cabin.

Susan: What cabin? 

Carl: Brandi wanted some place where we could get away. Escrow just closed yesterday.

Susan: You can afford a canbin, but you can't scrape up child support?

Carl: The check is in the mail.

Susan: Oh, no, it's not.

Julie: I found my dental guard, I'm ready. Stop fighting.

Susan: We are being as nice as we possibly can to one another.

Julie: Like I said, stop fighting.

Susan: Excuse me, Brandi, do you mind?

Brandi: Oh, ok.

Carl: Wait, Susan, you're right there, you can pick it up.

Susan: I could, but she's the one who threw it.

Carl: Come on, don't be petulant, just pick up the stupid can.

Susan: No.

Julie: I can pick it up.

Susan: Honey, stay out of this.

Carl: Fine, this is so typical.

Susan: Oh, I'm sorry, was that petulant, too?

Carl: You know what? You can pick up the damn can yourself.

Susan: Yeah, well, you just go to hell.

Mike: You want me to pick it up?
