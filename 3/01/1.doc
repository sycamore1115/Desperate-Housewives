After I died, I began to surrender the parts of myslef that were no longer necessary.
My desires, beliefs, ambitions, doubts, every trace of my humanity was diecarded.
I discorvered when moving through eternity, it helps to travel lightly. In fact, I held on to only one thing my memory.
It's astonishing to look back on the world I left behind, I remeber it all, every single detail.
Like my friend Bree Van de Kamp, I remeber the easy confidence of her smile, the gentle elegance of her hands, the refined warmth of her voice.
But what I remeber most about Bree, was the look of fear in her eyes.
Bree had started to realize her world was unraveiling, and for a woman who despised loose ends, that was unacceptable.

Bree: Rex, You need to get up.

Rex: It's not even light out.

Bree: Please hurry, if the kids see you sleeping down here, they're going to start asking questions.

Rex: Let them ask, I don't care anymore.

Bree: Well, I care, they don't need to be burden with our marital problems while we're working things out. 
      At lease, we can do is try to keep up appearances.

Rex: Yeah, appearances, I keep forgetting about appearances.

Bree: Oh, Rex, you look so tired.

Rex: I didn't sleep, this damn thing is so uncomfortable.

Bree: Well, why don't you move back upstairs and sleep in our bed?

Rex: We're in marriage counseling, Bree, I think that would confuse things.

Bree: It's just I miss you.

Rex: I know you do. Of course, if I don't find out start getting some sleep, pretty soon, 
     I'll be forced to move back upstairs out of sure exhaustion.

Yes, Bree was afraid of many things, but if there was one thing she wasn't afraid of it was a challenge.
