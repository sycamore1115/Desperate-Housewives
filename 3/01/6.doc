Rex: A dinner partyï¼ŸDo I have to go?

Bree: Well, given that we're hosting it, I'd say so. By the way, you won't be drinking at this party.

Rex: Why is that?

Bree: Because when you drink, you get chatty, no one needs to know that we're seeing Dr. Goldfine.

Rex: You know, if you spent half as much time working on our problems as you do covering them...

Bree: Not a drop.

Rex: You know, this is ridiculous, and this whole thing about us taking tennis lessons?

Bree: Well, the nurses at your office may start wondering why you're disappearing three times a week.
      Tennis lessons are a plausible alibi.

Rex: So these tennis lessons we're taking, how are we doing?     

Bree: My backhand's improving immensely, but you're still having problems with your serve.

Rex: Of course.
