Zack: Mrs. Warmington said she looked for mom's obituary and couldn't find it. Do you put one in?

Paul: I've had other things on my mind, Zack.

Zack: But how could you not do that? People are going to think we didn't care about her.

Paul: I doubt people will give it much thought, don't worry about it.

Zack: You never talk about her, she hasn't even been dead a month, and it's like you've totally forgotten she ever existed.

Paul: It's a little early for this kind of talk.

Zack: Maybe when you die, I won't put in an obituary.

Paul: That will be your choice to make, assuming you outlive me.
