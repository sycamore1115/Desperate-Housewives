Carlos: A dinner party, honey, I may be working late, the Dillman proposal's a complete mess.

Gabrielle: No, you promised to be home every night this week.

Carlos: I'll try but I can't guarantee anything, this is business.

Gabrielle: Says the prince as he rides off into the sunset, boy the movies ever get that wrong.

Carlos: You know what your problem is? You're very tense, you should go to a spa or go shopping, find a way to relax.

John: Hello?

Gabrielle: Where are you?

John: Algebra.

Gabrielle: You free at 4:00?

John: I'm not sure, I got track after school.

Gabrielle: Well, get here as fast as you can, my husband says I need to relax.

John: You want me to keep my gym clothes on like last time?

Gabrielle: If you would, please.
